# JtzMaps
A Brazilians jiu jitsu academy locator for practitioners of all levels and hobbyist to competitors  to enjoy training while they travel





# Description
I've always wanted to train Bjj (Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu) 
when I was out of town for vacation 
for at least 1-2 days in a friendly 
yet reputibale training environment.
I also wanted to be able to some how guage the 
intensity of the envirionment depending on my goals and health 
at a given time. Some Bjj Practitioners are compettitors some are enthusiastic hobbyists, or some are like my self 
hybrids of a sort sometimes we compete and some times we are busy with life and its responsibilities and want to 
just train a few times per week in a clean safe and family friendly envirionment.
Any ways this is turning into a whole blog post maybe I'll add a blog component later but for now I hope you can get the gist
Fun Safe Family friendly temporary training situations where practitioners of all levels can enjoy there favorite martial art.  

# Permissive License - Default (for now)
Not sure I know I want to make some parts open source for folks new to programming. But I always envisioned Jtzmaps as a business So to be determined how I do this open to suggestions.


# Background (What made you decide to build this particular app? What inspired you?)
I like to travel with my wife and toddler we all do Jiu Jitsu and 
I thought wouldn't it be cool if we had an app like Waze and AirBnB smashed together for travelling Bjj Practitioners of all levels 
to find safe family friendly places to train on a temporary basis
(most gyms require a membership  others require a mat fee between 20 and 30 dollars USD) as they travel. 


# How will you utilize RedwoodJS?
Im not exactly sure how I will use RedwoodJS but I have a feeling the sauce will be made using redwoods exellent GraphQl integration
because I have several bjj related ideas where I can reuse the RedwoodJS back end with differnt clients when I get hacking on those.
A little background when I first had the idea for JtzMaps I had just wrote my first line of code at 35 or 36 years of age and I was flat out intimidated 
by the process of choosing libraries and cobbling together my own thing. I like to call it when being a newb with imposter syndrome and js decision fatuige colide.
ANy ways RedwoodJS eliminates decision fatiuge and dtakes care a lot of the hard stuf for you like auth orm integration etc.
